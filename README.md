# TEST FOR LOADSMART

1. Build a dimensional data model in a database of your choosing, so it can hold the data set we sent you
and make data analysis available through SQL.
2. Load the data from the data set to the database model you've created, using any open source ETL tool or
language you want, but Python is preferred and is a great plus!
3. Provide a visual analysis so you can make a proof of concept of how your data model works, and how we
can use it, for a self-service data analysis. You can use any tool you want, but you will have a plus in case
of Tableau or Power BI.
